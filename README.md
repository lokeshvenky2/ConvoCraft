## About
ConvoCraft is a project focused on building an intelligent conversational chatbot. It leverages Python libraries, machine learning, and natural language processing (NLP) to provide a powerful platform for chatbot development. This project is interactive, flexible, and designed for learners and developers alike.

## Features
- **Developer**: Lokesh Rowthula
- Modular, step-by-step chatbot creation process.
- Explores techniques in machine learning and NLP.
- Interactive code and explanations to support learning.
- **First Cell**: Introductory markdown for project context.

## Use Case
The primary use case for ConvoCraft is to provide an intelligent conversational interface for various applications, such as:
1. **Customer Support**: Automating responses to common customer queries.
2. **Educational Tools**: Assisting users in learning through interactive Q&A.
3. **Personal Assistants**: Providing a virtual assistant for task management, reminders, and information retrieval.
4. **Data Insights**: Answering user queries based on structured or unstructured datasets.

## Specifications
- **Language**: Python
- **Environment**: Jupyter Notebook
- **Technologies Used**:
  - Natural Language Processing (NLP)
  - Machine Learning Algorithms
  - Python Libraries: TBD (update with actual libraries used in the notebook, e.g., `numpy`, `pandas`, `scikit-learn`, etc.)
- **Frameworks**: TBD (e.g., `TensorFlow`, `PyTorch` if applicable)
- **Input/Output Format**:
  - Input: User queries in natural language.
  - Output: Text-based conversational responses.
- **Dependencies**: Listed in `requirements.txt` (update based on actual dependencies).

## Feature Implementation
The project implements the following features:
1. **User Query Processing**:
   - Accepts user input in natural language.
   - Preprocesses the input (e.g., tokenization, stop-word removal).

2. **Response Generation**:
   - Generates intelligent responses based on predefined rules, datasets, or machine learning models.
   - Supports conversational context to maintain the flow of dialogue.

3. **Interactive Learning**:
   - Provides detailed code snippets and explanations.
   - Enables modification of the chatbot for various use cases through parameter tuning and retraining.

4. **Integration Capability**:
   - Modular structure allows integration with external APIs or frameworks for enhanced functionality.

## Technology Overview
This project leverages the following technologies and concepts:

### 1. **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**
   - **Objective**: Understanding and generating human language.
   - **Techniques**:
     - Tokenization and Lemmatization for text preprocessing.
     - Bag of Words (BoW) and TF-IDF for feature extraction.
     - Sentence similarity for matching queries with appropriate responses.

### 2. **Machine Learning**
   - **Objective**: Training models for conversational response prediction.
   - **Algorithms**:
     - Supervised learning for intent classification (e.g., `scikit-learn`).
     - Clustering techniques for unsupervised context grouping.

### 3. **Python Libraries**
   - **Core Libraries**:
     - `numpy` and `pandas` for data manipulation.
     - `scikit-learn` for machine learning algorithms.
     - `nltk` or `spaCy` for NLP tasks.
   - **Visualization**:
     - `matplotlib` or `seaborn` for data visualization (if used in exploratory analysis).

### 4. **Jupyter Notebook**
   - Interactive environment for combining code, markdown, and outputs in a single document.
   - Ideal for prototyping, debugging, and presenting data science workflows.

## Setup
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/ConvoCraft.git
